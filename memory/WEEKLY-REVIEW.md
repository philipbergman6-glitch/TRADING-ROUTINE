### Closed Trades
| Ticker | Entry | Exit | P&L | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|-----|-------|
| MSFT | $436.20 | ~$401 | ~-$1,690 (-8.1%) | 10% trailing stop triggered Jun 09; exited past -7% cut level |
| NVDA | $219.64 | ~$199 | ~-$1,857 (-9.4%) | 10% trailing stop triggered Jun 09; exited past -7% cut level |

### Open Positions at Week End
| Ticker | Entry | Close | Unrealized | Stop |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|------|
| XOM | $150.14 | $146.98 | -$448.72 (-2.11%) | $137.24 (10% trail, HWM $152.49) |

### What Worked
- GTC trailing stops did their job — capped MSFT/NVDA losses without manual intervention when tech rolled over.
- Friday discipline: held 2 unused trade slots rather than forcing entries into hot CPI (4.2%) + hot PPI (6.5%) + VIX 22 + live FOMC next week.
- Sector rotation read: exited stalled AI-tech, pivoted to energy (XOM) per rule 9.
- Daily research caught the macro turn early (Jun 09 pre-market flagged CPI as binary; didn't add risk into it).

### What Didn't Work
- Both closed trades exited at -8.1% and -9.4% — past the -7% manual cut line. The cut rule wasn't executed intraday; the wider trail did the exit instead.
- Under-deployed all week (0% → 19.5% vs 75-85% target). Cash drag is its own risk vs the benchmark.
- Tech re-entry (MSFT/NVDA Jun 3) was into fading catalysts (post-Build, post-RTX Spark) — paid for it Jun 09.
- XOM entry caught an oil pullback immediately; -2.1% after three sessions, thesis intact but timing soft.

### Key Lessons
- The -7% manual cut must fire BEFORE the 10% trail does — monitor intraday, don't wait for EOD. Cost of inaction this week: ~1.5-2.4% extra slippage per position.
- Entering on faded catalysts is not "sector momentum" — require a forward catalyst, not a recent one.
- Hot-inflation regime + VIX > 20 = wider stops get hit more; sizing/holding through binary macro weeks needs more caution.

### Adjustments for Next Week
- FOMC Jun 16-17: no new entries before the decision. Re-engage Jun 18+ with the scout list (GOOGL/META comm-svcs, energy adds).
- Post-FOMC priority: rebuild to 75-85% deployed with 2-3 quality setups (3 weekly slots available).
- Enforce -7% cut at midday scan, every session, mechanically.
- Manage XOM by rules: manual cut $139.63, trail $137.24.

### Overall Grade: C-

No strategy rule changes — failures were execution (late -7% cuts) and timing, not rule design. Flagging for watch: if -7% cuts are missed again next week, add an explicit intraday cut-check rule to TRADING-STRATEGY.md.
